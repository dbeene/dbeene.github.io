                    I am a Ph.D. student at the University of New Mexico in the Department of Geography & Environmental
                    Studies.
                    Under the guidance of my advisor, Dr. Yan Lin, I am studying the ways that we can leverage GIScience
                    and
                    spatial
                    statistics to better understand how social dimensions of health and environmental exposures are
                    deeply
                    interconnected. The majority of our work is centered on the legacy of uranium mining on the Navajo
                    Nation,
                    and the associated health outcomes that are compunded by parallel histories of disparity,
                    disposession,
                    and
                    culture. Because my work is centered on Indigenous lands and cultures, I acknowledge and respect
                    Indigenous
                    People as traditional stewards of the land and the enduring relationship that exists between
                    Indigenous
                    People and their traditional territories.<br><br>

                            There are more than 500 abandoned uranium mines (AUMs) on the Navajo Nation. The
                            reclamation
                            status of many of these mines varies; so too does the extent of contamination. As part

                            NIH
                            P-50 award, we developed a proximity based-model of AUM contaminant transport that
                            accounts
                            for mobility due to the movement and deposition of mine waste due to wind and water. The
                            final
                            model utilizes fuzzy classifiers and a weighted linear combination of multiple
                            environmental
                            factors: proximity to AUMs, roads, and downslope drainages, vegetative robustness,

                            Livestock
                            in many parts of the Nation are traditionally shepherded in areas that
                            may be downstream from abandoned uranium mines (AUMs). The mountains surrounding Cove

                            many of these sites and the residents of that community are interested in the associated

                            risks with consuming meat from livestock. As part of a team consisting of community

                            processes

                            (SWAT-CUP), I have been able to predict total sediment moved in tons/hectare from one
                            hydrologic response unit (HRU) to others downstream. The second part of
                            this model is currently underway and uses topological relationships to estimate the
                            relationship between
                            magnitude of past mining activity and uranium mobility through surface water and
                            sediment.

                            Ongoing water rights adjudicaiton in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of New Mexico has pitted
                            water users, farmers, and states against each other. I argue here that the adjudicaiton
                            process has also incentivized a widespread agricultural transiton to pecan orchards from
                            other crops that potentially require less water. Using a sequential exploratory research
                            design, I explore how water governance has precipitated ecological change and the loss of
                            cultural knowledge, political
                            change and the exacerbation of inequalities, and legal conflict leading to political battles
