                            There are more than 500 abandoned uranium mines (AUMs) on the Navajo Nation. The reclamation
                            status of many of these mines varies; so too does the extent of contamination. As part of a NIH
                            P-50 award,  we developed a proximity based-model of AUM contaminant transport that accounts 
                            for mobility due to the movement and deposition of mine waste due to wind and water. The final 
                            model utilizes fuzzy classifiers and a weighted linear combination of multiple environmental 
                            factors: proximity to AUMs, roads, and downslope drainages, vegetative robustness, landform 
                            classification, a prevailing wind index, and topographic wind exposure. A paper detailing this
                            work can be found <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-020-09257-3"

                            Cove is a small community and chapter of the Navajo Nation in northeastern Arizona. Livestock
                            in many parts of the Nation are traditionally shepherded in areas that
                            may be downstream from abandoned uranium mines (AUMs). The mountains surrounding Cove are home to
                            many of these sites and the residents of that community are interested in the associated potential
                            risks with consuming meat from livestock. As part of a team consisting of community members
                            and researchers at Dine' College, Northern Arizona University, Montana State University - Billings,
                            and UNM, we have developed methods to relate grazing activity with potential exposures from plants
                            and water. Biological samples from these livestock are currently being examined at NAU.

                            Seeking to refine our GIS-MCDA model of potential environmental contamination from abandoned uranium
                            mines (AUMs) on the Navajo Nation, I have began to explore ways to more accurately model the processes
                            of sediment deposition across a distributed watershed. Leveraging the <a href="https://swat.tamu.edu/" 
                            target="_blank">Soil-Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)</a> and the SWAT Calibration & Uncertainty Programs 
                            (SWAT-CUP), I have been able to predict total sediment moved in tons/hectare from one hydrologic response unit (HRU) to others downstream. The second part of 
                            this model is currently underway and uses topological relationships to estimate the relationship between
                            magnitude of past mining activity and uranium mobility through surface water and sediment.
